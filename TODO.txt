STUFF TO BE ADDED, IN DECREASING ORDER OF MOST DESIRED

- kuromasu: add red colour when empty>number
- scoring
- menu system with score tracking and puzzle selector

COMPLETE LIST OF STUFF TO BE ADDED

- general:
  - make a menu system for selecting puzzles. it should cache, and only
    reload upon the user issuing a refresh command. in addition, add score 
    tracking. in the menu, display whether the puzzle is solved, along with
    the best time and lowest amount of mouse clicks. the puzzle cache and the
    scores should be stored in a text file. file format: one puzzle per line.
    filename, puzzle name, [author,] difficulty, size, date solved, best time
    (in hundredths of a second), best score (number of clicks)
  - in accordance with the above, add a visible timer and mouse clicks. while
    doing that, also add some info about the puzzle, as the credits,
    difficulty and puzzle name. at the top left, display static info such as
    puzzle name, id and author. at the top right, display time spent and
    number of clicks done.
  - for extremely time intensive solving heuristics: estimate the number
    of combinations needed to investigate for a given move and try moves
    in order of increasing work
  - nice resizing of numbers
  - add achievements! for instance:
    - for each puzzle type, achievement for completing one puzzle without using
      hints
    - complete at least one puzzle of each type without using hints
    - complete one puzzle of difficulty "extra"/"extreme" without using hints
    - complete one puzzle using the hint function only
    - complete a puzzle using no unnecessary moves, without using hints
    - complete a puzzle in less than 10 seconds without using hints
    - complete 1000 puzzles without using hints
    - complete at least 50% of all puzzles of any kind
    - complete a level with the fewest possible clicks
  - print error message (at least into log.txt or error.txt) when something
    bad happens
  - change difficulty from string to int (can be done by changing the grabber
    programs, changing each loadpuzzle() (use table lookup to display string)
    and change all files (don't regrab them, but make a program to go through
    all files and replace string with int)
  - make fancy controls:
    - hold mouse button and mark all unfilled cells
  - automatic puzzle generation
  - the code is very messy with lots of duplication, but i've decided against
    refactoring

- kuromasu
  - number in round cell within square

- nurikabe
  - make fancy controls:
    - enclose finalized island
    - fill enclosed region with island
  - improve solver, get those last puzzles!

- heyawake
  - improve solver speed, 8 hours on heyC138 is way too much. check if it has
    anything to do with that rectangle with 16 cells, and rectify

- picross
  - make better legalrow,legalcolumn routines: given clues and partially
    filled in cells, is it possible to finish correctly? use dp

- hitori
  - improve solver (it's not very good right now)

- masyu
  - improve solver (it's not very good right now)

- slitherlink
  - improve solver (it's not very good right now)

- minesweeper
  - improve solver

- yajilin
  - add v as legal number. don't know why it was removed in the first place,
    the direction is in another layer

- add games (higher up => more likely to be implemented, either because it's
  easy to implement or the game looks more interesting/fun to me). number in
  brackets indicate the number of puzzles at janko.
  - numberlink (arukone) [210] http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Arukone/index.htm
    - normal edge dragging, easily stolen from masyu
    - also check the variants arukone^2 and arukone^3
  - gokigen naname [380] http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Gokigen/index.htm

      on a domino

    - place plus/minus signs according to hints, two adjacent cells cannot
      contain same sign
  - shikaku [240] http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Sikaku/index.htm
    - implement the controls in the following way: at the beginning, there
      will be 1x1 rectangles on top of every number. the size of a rectangle
      is changed by holding the mouse button an edge cell and moving the
      pointer in any direction. if the mouse is dragged out of the rectangle,
      the size increases by one in that direction. if the mouse is dragged
      inwards, the size decreases by one in that direction. mouse dragging
      routines are easily stolen from masyu.
    - how to show current size?

GENERAL GOAL

make a client for playing nurikabe, heyawake, akari, slitherlink, yajilin,
hashiwokakero, masyu and possibly other fun puzzles. use sdl (maybe opengl)
for graphics.

features:
- automatic puzzle generation
- read puzzles from files supplied by user
- in-game hint function which uses a fabolous solver written by myself
  - the hint system has several levels: 
    - only show trivial hints (like surrounding the 1 in nurikabe,
      forced placement of light in akari, one possible way to fill in
      a rectangle independently of surrounding)
    - medium hints (like o | ? | o in heyawake, fill the ?)
    - deep hints (stuff requiring backtracking or advanced reasoning)
  - the solver should be able to solve every puzzle, ever
- in-game intervention of player moves: warn about wrong moves
  (can be turned off, or warn about trivial mistakes only, or warn also about
  deeper mistakes)

framework:
- make a general graphics engine with the following helper functionality:
  - given a screen resolution and grid size, scale appropriately
  - støtt følgende mouse events:
    - klikk i celle
    - dra fra celle til nabocelle
    - klikk på ikon over (som check, try, etc)
    - klikk på en kant mellom to celler (slitherlink)
  - støtt tastaturstyring:
    - cursor: flytt rundt
    - space: endre cell
    - shift+cursor: legge til/fjerne kant
    - cursormode for slitherlink: naviger langs kanter
  - støtte for full undo, som for hvert trekk lagrer hvilke grafiske endringer
    som skjer (dvs endret innhold i rute, endring i kanter som trekkes

documentation:
- for each game, write a nice article (html page?) showing:
  - the rules (with screenshots)
  - the heuristics used by the solver (demonstrated with screenshots),
    containing.
    - when to apply the heuristic
    - how to apply it (what cells to fill with what)
    - which rule we violate by filling out the cells in a wrong way
